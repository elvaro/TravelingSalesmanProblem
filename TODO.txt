Things that need to be done in no particular order:

-   Finish the layout
-       Have some sort of grid in the center that can display the points
-           If no data is loaded then maybe it should display that text in the center along with a button to load the data
-       Select the starting location
-           Maybe the user should be able to click on a point and set that as the starting point or select the point from a dropdown menu
-       In the bottom row, have the following
-           A dropdown menu that contains the all the implemented TSP algorithms, allowing the user to select which one to use
-           A button that starts the TSP process
-   In the help menu, maybe bring up a dialog that links to a wiki page for each algorithm implemented.
-       This could either be an internal webview in java or open up the default browser on the computer
-   Implement the NearestNeighAlgorithm
-       Add some basic test cases for that algorithm
-   Create some logo for the top header of the application
-       Or find some logo on the internet
-   Add some error handling for a faulty tsv file
